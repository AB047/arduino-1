This project uses git submodules to include the Manchester library from ("arduino-libs-manchester":https://github.com/mchr3k/arduino-libs-manchester). 
The correct way to interact with this is as follows. 

Getting started
------

Use one of the following:

      git clone --recursive <git url> .
  
Or

      git clone <git url> .
      git submodule update --init

Picking up a change to the Submodule
------

A git submodule refers to an external repository at an explicit revision. There are two ways to update the content of a submodule. 

      git submodule update libraries/Manchester

This will discard any changes in libraries/Manchester and fetch the current fixed revision associated with the submodule. 

      cd libraries/Manchester
      git pull origin master
      cd ..
      git add Manchester
      git commit -m 'pickup latest changes from external repo'
  
This is the correct approach to fetch the latest changes from the external repository. The git pull within the submodule folder does the fetching from the external repository. The subsequent git commit in the parent folder publishes into the enclosing repository that the revision of the submodule has been changed. 

Making changes to a submodule in place

NOTE: I am still trying to work this out. I am currently hitting [this issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4445738/unable-to-push-commits-from-a-git-submodule).
